### Exercise 1: Sinatra routes

The `roll_die` method below simulates rolling a die with the given number of sides. If you call `roll_die(6)`, you'll get a random number between 1 and 6. If you call `roll_die(20)`, you'll get a random number between 1 and 20.

Create three Sinatra routes that use this method:

* The `/roll/4` path should output "Rolling 4 sided die:", followed by the result of calling `roll_die(4)`.
* The `/roll/6` path should output "Rolling 6 sided die:", followed by the result of calling `roll_die(6)`.
* The `/roll/20` path should output "Rolling 20 sided die:", followed by the result of calling `roll_die(20)`.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra'

def roll_die(sides)
  rand(sides) + 1
end

# YOUR CODE HERE
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have your server running, you should be able to load any of the paths you've set up, and then refresh the browser repeatedly to get different random numbers.

### Exercise 2: ERB templates

Below is a Sinatra app meant to show items in an HTML "unordered list" (the `<ul>` element). There are two routes.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra'

get('/fruits') do
  @items = ["apples", "oranges", "pears"]
  erb :list
end

get('/meats') do
  @items = ["chicken", "beef", "lamb"]
  erb :list
end
{% endhighlight %}

The `/meats` route should render HTML like this, showing a list of meats:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken</li>
        <li>beef</li>
        <li>lamb</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

...And the `/fruits` route should render nearly-identical HTML, but with a list of fruits.

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
        <li>apples</li>
        <li>oranges</li>
        <li>pears</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

Both routes store arrays in the `@items` instance variable. And both routes rely on the below ERB code, which is stored in the `list.erb` file within the `views` subfolder, to render the list. Your job is to finish the template so that the HTML output matches the samples above.

You'll need to use a regular embedding tag with the `each` method to process each item in the list, and an output embedding tag to output the current list item.

{% highlight text %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <% # YOUR CODE HERE %>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

### Exercise 3: Named parameters

Take your solution to Exercise 1, and convert the `/roll/4`, `/roll/6`, and `/roll/20` routes to a single route that uses a named parameter for the number of sides. (You'll need to convert the parameter from a string to an integer before passing it to the `roll_die` method.)

When you're ready, have a look at [our solution](/solutions/ch1415_03.html).
