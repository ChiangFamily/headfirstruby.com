## Chapter 2 - Methods and Classes

### Exercise 1: HTML methods

We need to create a web page, and typing all the HTML out by hand would be pretty tedious. Let's create some methods to help us out.

An HTML paragraph tag is used to mark text in a web page. It looks like this:

{% highlight html %}
<p>Hello, web!</p>
{% endhighlight %}

Between the `<p>` and `</p>` tags, we can put whatever text we want.

So let's start there. Create a method named `paragraph` that takes a string as a parameter. It should create a new string that starts with `<p>`, ends with `</p>`, and contains the parameter string in the middle. Don't just print the string with `puts` inside the method, though; let the string be the method's return value, and let the caller print it.

HTML also has image tags, which look like this:

{% highlight html %}
<img src='puppy.jpg' width='800' height='600'/>
{% endhighlight %}

The `src`, `width`, and `height` attributes of the tag contain information that helps the browser display the image. The `src` attribute specifies the file that the image should be loaded from, and the `width` and `height` attributes specify how wide and how tall the image should appear.

Now, create an `image` method that returns an `img` tag as a string. It should take 3 parameters: an image source string, a width, and a height. The width and height values should be optional, and should use a default of `100` for each. Interpolate the parameters into the HTML string as the attribute values.

After defining the `paragraph` and `image` methods, try calling them a few times to output some HTML, with image file names and text of your choosing.

When you're ready, have a look at [the solution](/solutions/ch02_01.html).
