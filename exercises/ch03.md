## Chapter 3 - Inheritance

### Exercise 1: Square class

In the Chapter 2 bonus exercises, we created a `Rectangle` class like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Rectangle
  attr_reader :width, :height

  def width=(value)
    if value < 0
      raise "Width can't be negative!"
    end
    @width = value
  end

  def height=(value)
    if value < 0
      raise "Height can't be negative!"
    end
    @height = value
  end

  def area
    width * height
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Your next task is to create a subclass of `Rectangle`, named `Square`. `Square` should override the `width=` method to set both the width and height to the given value when called. It should do the same with the `height=` method. (Don't worry about checking whether the values are negative.) All other methods should be inherited from `Rectangle`. The `area` method should work without any need to override it.

When you're ready, have a look at [the solution](/solutions/ch03_01.html).
