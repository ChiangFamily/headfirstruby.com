## Chapter 3 - Inheritance

### Exercise 1: Square class

In the Chapter 2 bonus exercises, we created a `Rectangle` class like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Rectangle
  attr_reader :width, :height

  def width=(value)
    if value < 0
      raise "Width can't be negative!"
    end
    @width = value
  end

  def height=(value)
    if value < 0
      raise "Height can't be negative!"
    end
    @height = value
  end

  def area
    width * height
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Your next task is to create a subclass of `Rectangle`, named `Square`. `Square` should override the `width=` method to set both the width and height to the given value when called. It should do the same with the `height=` method. (Don't worry about checking whether the values are negative.) All other methods should be inherited from `Rectangle`. The `area` method should work without any need to override it.

When you're ready, have a look at [the solution](/solutions/ch03_01.html).

### Exercise 2: Cupcakes

We have a `Confection` class representing baked desserts below. Your job is to create a new subclass of `Confection`, named `Cupcake`. Cupcakes need to be baked just like other confections, but they also need to be frosted afterward.

Write a `prepare` method for your `Cupcake` class that prints `"Baking at 350 degrees for 25 minutes."`, and *then* prints `"Applying frosting."` Do this *without* duplicating the `puts` line from the `prepare` method of the `Confection` class.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Confection
  def prepare
    # Don't duplicate this line in the subclass!
    puts "Baking at 350 degrees for 25 minutes."
  end
end

# CREATE YOUR Cupcake SUBCLASS HERE!

# The below code should output the following
# 2 lines of text:
#
# Baking at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.
# Applying frosting.
cupcake = Cupcake.new
cupcake.prepare
{% endhighlight %}
