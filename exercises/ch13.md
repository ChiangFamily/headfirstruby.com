## Chapter 13 - Unit Testing

### Exercise 1: Test assertions

Below is a `Minitest::Test` subclass with a couple failing assertions:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'minitest/autorun'

class TestMath < Minitest::Test
  def test_addition
    assert(2 + 2 == 5)
  end

  def test_multiplication
    assert(3 * 4 == 13)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Running them produces this output:

{% highlight text %}
Run options: --seed 5157

# Running:

FF

Finished in 0.001554s, 1287.0013 runs/s, 1287.0013 assertions/s.

  1) Failure:
TestMath#test_addition [-:5]:
Failed assertion, no message given.


  2) Failure:
TestMath#test_multiplication [-:9]:
Failed assertion, no message given.

2 runs, 2 assertions, 2 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
{% endhighlight %}

See if you can get the tests passing.

### Exercise 2: Test-driven development

Test-driven development is a popular practice where the developer writes the tests *first*, knowing they will fail, and then implements the code so that they pass. TDD helps ensure you write well-encapsulated, easily testable code.

Let's try TDD out now. Below is code for a `Rectangle` class, as well as a unit test for it. The test is failing right now, though, because the `area` and `perimeter` methods are empty. Implement the methods in `Rectangle` so that the tests pass.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'minitest/autorun'

class Rectangle

  attr_accessor :width, :height

  def area
    # YOUR CODE HERE
  end

  def perimeter
    # YOUR CODE HERE
  end

end

class TestRectangle < Minitest::Test

  def test_area
    rectangle = Rectangle.new
    rectangle.width = 2
    rectangle.height = 4
    assert_equal(8, rectangle.area,
      "Area should equal width * height")
  end

  def test_perimeter
    rectangle = Rectangle.new
    rectangle.width = 2
    rectangle.height = 4
    assert_equal(12, rectangle.perimeter,
      "Perimeter should equal width * 2 + height * 2")
  end

end
{% endhighlight %}

Running the test produces this failing output:

{% highlight text %}
Run options: --seed 57578

# Running:

FF

Finished in 0.000862s, 2320.1856 runs/s, 2320.1856 assertions/s.

  1) Failure:
TestRectangle#test_area [-:22]:
Area should equal width * height.
Expected: 8
  Actual: nil


  2) Failure:
TestRectangle#test_perimeter [-:30]:
Perimeter should equal width * 2 + height * 2.
Expected: 12
  Actual: nil

2 runs, 2 assertions, 2 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
{% endhighlight %}

When you're ready, have a look at [the solution](/solutions/ch13_02.html).


### Exercise 3: Test setup

The unit test from the previous exercise has some repeated code for setting up the `Rectangle` object. Move that code to a `setup` method within the test class, to eliminate the duplication. (You'll need to change the local variable that holds the `Rectangle` to an instance variable.)

When you're ready, have a look at [our solution](/solutions/ch13_03.html).
