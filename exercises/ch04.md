## Chapter 4 - Initializing instances

### Exercise 1: Initializing rectangles

Remember our `Rectangle` class from previous chapters?

{% highlight ruby %}
class Rectangle
  attr_reader :width, :height

  def width=(value)
    if value < 0
      raise "Width can't be negative!"
    end
    @width = value
  end

  def height=(value)
    if value < 0
      raise "Height can't be negative!"
    end
    @height = value
  end

  def area
    width * height
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Your next task is to add an `initialize` method that takes two parameters: a width and a height. Assign those values to the `width` and `height` attributes of the new instance. You should utilize the existing validation in the attribute writer methods, so that an error is raised if a negative value is passed. When you're done, this code should work:

{% highlight ruby %}
rectangle = Rectangle.new(2, 4)
puts rectangle.area # Output: 8
{% endhighlight %}

When you're ready, have a look at [the solution](/solutions/ch04_01.html).

_Extra Credit_: For bonus points, revise the `initialize` method to take keyword arguments instead of positional arguments!
