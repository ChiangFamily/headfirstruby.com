## Chapter 6 - Block return values

### Exercise 1: Using a block return value in a method

Below is a method named `bar_chart`. We're going to use "string multiplication" (`"$" * 3` returns `"$$$"`, for example) to make a primitive bar chart, using the return values from a block. Fill in the missing line of code in the middle of the `each` block to yield `value` to a block, and "multiply" the string `"$"` by the block return value. Then print the result.

{% highlight ruby %}
def bar_chart(array)
  array.each do |value|
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    puts "$" * yield(value)
  end
end

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

puts "Multiplication:"
# The next line of code should print:
# $$$
# $$$$$$
# $$$$$$$$$
# $$$$$$$$$$$$
# $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
bar_chart(array) { |number| 3 * number }

puts "Division:"
# The next line of code should print:
# $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
# $$$$$$$$$$
# $$$$$$
# $$$$$
# $$$$
bar_chart(array) { |number| 20.0 / number }
{% endhighlight %}
