## Chapter 5 - Arrays and Blocks

### Exercise 1: Converting a String to an Array and back

We have a string that's supposed to contain a list of fruit, separated by commas. But there are some items in there that shouldn't be. Write a script that does the following:

* Use the `split` method with an argument of `", "` to split the string into an array.
* Use the `pop` method to discard the last array element.
* Use the `shift` method to discard the first array element.
* Use the `join` method with an argument of `", "` to join the array back into a string, and print the result.

### Solution

{% highlight ruby %}
fruit_string = "boulder, apple, banana, peach, cow"
fruit = fruit_string.split(", ")
fruit.pop
fruit.shift
puts fruit.join(", ")
{% endhighlight %}
