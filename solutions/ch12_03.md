## Chapter 12 - Exceptions

### Exercise 3: Handling multiple exception types

The call to `random_failure` raises either a `ThisError`, `ThatError`, or `TheOtherError`, randomly. Rescue `ThisError`, and print the message "I caught this!". Rescue `ThatError`, and print "I caught that!". Allow `TheOtherError` to fail normally.

{% highlight ruby %}
class ThisError < StandardError
end

class ThatError < StandardError
end

class TheOtherError < StandardError
end

def random_failure
  number = rand(0..2)
  if number == 0
    raise ThisError, "Whoops!"
  elsif number == 1
    raise ThatError, "Uh, oh!"
  elsif number == 2
    raise TheOtherError, "Oh, no!"
  end
end

begin
  random_failure
rescue ThisError
  puts "I caught this!"
rescue ThatError
  puts "I caught that!"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Try running your code repeatedly. You should see one of these three outputs each time:

{% highlight text %}
I caught this!
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}
I caught that!
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}
test.rb:17:in `random_failure': Oh, no! (TheOtherError)
        from test.rb:22:in `<main>'
{% endhighlight %}
