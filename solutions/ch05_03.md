## Chapter 5 - Arrays and Blocks

### Exercise 3: IRB Session

Here's the output you'll see when you type those expressions into `irb`. We've also added some notes about what the results mean.

{% highlight text %}
2.2.2 :001 > numbers = [3, 29, 5, 12, 18]
=> [3, 29, 5, 12, 18]
{% endhighlight %}

Nothing too fancy here; this just creates an array of numbers and stores a reference to the array in a variable. Make sure you use whole numbers, though, or the next expression won't work.

As always, the result of an assignment expression is the value assigned, which is why IRB prints `=> [3, 29, 5, 12, 18]` afterward.

{% highlight text %}
2.2.2 :002 > numbers.each { |number| puts number * number }
9
841
25
144
324
=> [3, 29, 5, 12, 18]
{% endhighlight %}

This multiplies each number in the array by itself (squares it), and prints the result.

The return value of the `each` method is the array that you called it on, so IRB again prints `=> [3, 29, 5, 12, 18]` after this method call (and the following ones).

{% highlight text %}
2.2.2 :003 > numbers.each { |number| puts number.odd? }
true
true
true
false
false
=> [3, 29, 5, 12, 18]
{% endhighlight %}

This calls the `odd?` method on each number in the array, and prints the result. The `odd?` method returns `true` if the number you called it on is odd, and `false` if the number is even. (There's also an `even?` method that does the opposite; why not try it out now?)

{% highlight text %}
2.2.2 :004 > numbers.each { |number| puts "$" * number }
$$$
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$
$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
=> [3, 29, 5, 12, 18]
{% endhighlight %}

"Multiplying" a string by a number returns that string, repeated that number of times. (So, `"ab" * 3` returns `"ababab"`.) The above call to `each` results in a kind of primitive bar chart.

{% highlight text %}
2.2.2 :005 > strings = ["I", "ma", "a", "ybuR", "retsam"]
=> ["I", "ma", "a", "ybuR", "retsam"]
{% endhighlight %}

Here we create a new array, this one filled with strings, and assign it to a new variable.

{% highlight text %}
2.2.2 :006 > strings.each { |string| puts string.reverse }
I
am
a
Ruby
master
=> ["I", "ma", "a", "ybuR", "retsam"]
{% endhighlight %}

This block calls `reverse` on each string in the array, and prints the result.

{% highlight text %}
2.2.2 :007 > strings.each { |string| puts string.length }
1
2
1
4
6
=> ["I", "ma", "a", "ybuR", "retsam"]
{% endhighlight %}

This block prints the length of each string in the array.

{% highlight text %}
2.2.2 :008 > exit
{% endhighlight %}

As always, type `exit` when you're ready to return to the system prompt.
