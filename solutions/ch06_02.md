## Chapter 6 - Block return values

### Exercise 2: IRB session

Here's the output you'll see when you type those expressions into `irb`. We've also added some notes about what the results mean.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ irb
2.2.2 :001 > numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
{% endhighlight %}

Here we assign an array of numbers to a variable.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :002 > numbers.find { |number| number > 2 }
 => 3
{% endhighlight %}

The `find` method is just like `find_all`, except that it returns only the *first* array element for which the block returns `true`. The first element that's greater than `2` is, of course, `3`.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :003 > numbers.find_all { |number| number > 2 }
 => [3, 4, 5]
{% endhighlight %}

And as we saw before, `find_all` returns an array of *all* the elements for which the block returns `true`. `3`, `4`, and `5` are all greater than `2`.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :004 > numbers.reject { |number| number > 2 }
 => [1, 2]
{% endhighlight %}

The `reject` method is the opposite of `find_all`; it returns an array of all elements for which the block returns `false` (*rejecting* the elements for which it returns `true`). `3`, `4`, and `5` are greater than `2`, and so they were rejected.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :005 > numbers.partition { |number| number > 2 }
 => [[3, 4, 5], [1, 2]]
{% endhighlight %}

The `partition` method returns two arrays, one with all the values for which the block returned `true`, and a second with the values for which the block returned `false`.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :006 > strings = ["Ruby", "is", "so", "cool"]
 => ["Ruby", "is", "so", "cool"]
{% endhighlight %}

Here we create an array of string values.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :007 > strings.find { |string| string.length > 2 }
 => "Ruby"
{% endhighlight %}

This finds the first string with a `length` greater than two characters.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :008 > strings.find_all { |string| string.length > 2 }
 => ["Ruby", "cool"]
{% endhighlight %}

This finds *all* strings with a `length` greater than two characters.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :009 > strings.reject { |string| string.length > 2 }
 => ["is", "so"]
{% endhighlight %}

This *rejects* any string with a length greater than two characters.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :010 > strings.partition { |string| string.length > 2 }
=> [["Ruby", "cool"], ["is", "so"]]
{% endhighlight %}

This partitions the array into two arrays: one with all the strings longer than two characters, and a second array with strings that are not.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :011 > exit
$
{% endhighlight %}

As always, typing `exit` by itself exits `irb`, and returns us to the system prompt.
