## Chapter 1 - More With Less

### Exercise 1: Reverse-o-Matic

The goal for your first exercise is to write a script that reverses text. Here's what it should do:

* Prompt the user to type a phrase and press Enter.
* Use the `gets` method to read the string the user entered.
* Call `chomp` on the user's string to remove the newline character from the end.
* Call `reverse` on the string, and display the result.

### Solution

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Enter a phrase:"
input = gets
phrase = input.chomp
puts "Here is your phrase, backwards:"
puts phrase.reverse
{% endhighlight %}
