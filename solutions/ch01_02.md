## Chapter 1 - More With Less

### Exercise 2: IRB Session

Here's the output you'll see when you type those expressions into `irb`. We've also added some notes about what the results mean.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ irb
2.2.2 :001 > my_string = "ruby is so cool"
 => "ruby is so cool"
{% endhighlight %}

Here we assign a string to a variable. The result of an assignment expression is the value assigned, which is why `irb` prints `=> "ruby is so cool"` after you press Enter. The string is now stored in the variable, and ready for use in subsequent expressions.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :002 > my_string.methods

{% endhighlight %}

Don't be overwhelmed! This is a list of all methods available on the `String` object referenced by `my_string`. (We'll explain what the `[]` brackets and `:` characters mean in later chapters; they're not important for now.) Some of these will be useful to a Ruby beginner, some of them won't. But you can't hurt anything by playing around with them, so let's try a few...

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :003 > my_string.next
 => "ruby is so coom"
{% endhighlight %}

The `next` method produces whatever string would be "next" in a sequence, so `"a".next` would return `"b"`. It increments the last letter in the string, and "m" follows "l", which is why we get `"ruby is so coom"`.

Note that `next` (and most other methods) return a *new* string; they don't modify the original. So the string referenced by `my_string` is untouched for our next operation...

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :004 > my_string.reverse.upcase
 => "LOOC OS SI YBUR"
{% endhighlight %}

These are methods we've used before, but here we *chain* them together using dot operators. `my_string.reverse` returns `"looc os si ybur"`, and then `upcase` captializes the result.

Note that some developers frown on chaining methods together like this (in part because it can cause an error if a method doesn't return the value you expect). But you'll still see it in the wild, so it's good to know that it's possible.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :005 > my_string.insert(11, "very, very ")
 => "ruby is so very, very cool"
{% endhighlight %}

The `insert` method inserts one string into another, at the character position you specify. It's a rare exception among `String` methods; it *does* modify the original string.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :006 > "Rolling a die... we got #{ rand(1..6) }"
 => "Rolling a die... we got 6"
{% endhighlight %}

You can use any Ruby code when interpolating values into a string with `#{}`. Here, we call `rand` to generate a random number (so the string you get back may be different). The `1..6` is a *range*, indicating the set of all numbers between 1 and 6, so this will get us a random number between 1 and 6.

After you press Enter to submit this expression, try using the up-arrow on your keyboard to bring the previous command back and run it again to see the various results!

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :007 > "There are #{ 60 * 60 } seconds in an hour."
 => "There are 3600 seconds in an hour."
{% endhighlight %}

Here, we use `#{}` interpolation to multiply two numbers and embed the result in our string.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :008 > 42.to_s
 => "42"
{% endhighlight %}

The `to_s` method converts an object to a string. In the case of a number, we get a string representing that number.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :009 > "42".to_i
 => 42
{% endhighlight %}

The `to_i` method converts an object to an integer. Since this is a string containing nothing but a number, that's the number we get back.

{% highlight ruby %}
2.2.2 :010 > exit
$ 
{% endhighlight %}

Typing `exit` by itself exits `irb`, and returns us to the system prompt.
