### Exercise 1: Sinatra routes

The `roll_die` method below simulates rolling a die with the given number of sides. If you call `roll_die(6)`, you'll get a random number between 1 and 6. If you call `roll_die(20)`, you'll get a random number between 1 and 20.

Create three Sinatra routes that use this method:

* The `/roll/4` path should output "Rolling 4 sided die:", followed by the result of calling `roll_die(4)`.
* The `/roll/6` path should output "Rolling 6 sided die:", followed by the result of calling `roll_die(6)`.
* The `/roll/20` path should output "Rolling 20 sided die:", followed by the result of calling `roll_die(20)`.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra'

def roll_die(sides)
  rand(sides) + 1
end

get('/roll/4') do
  "Rolling 4 sided die: #{roll_die(4)}"
end

get('/roll/6') do
  "Rolling 6 sided die: #{roll_die(6)}"
end

get('/roll/20') do
  "Rolling 20 sided die: #{roll_die(20)}"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have your server running, you can load any of these paths, and then refresh the browser repeatedly to get different random numbers.
