### Exercise 1: Softball team

Joe Walsh is having a bad day. He couldn't convince the newest employee, Lisa Wagner, to join the company softball team, so he had to draft the team mascot to play for tonight's game instead. And *now* his script to print the company roster is broken.

Here's the problem: Joe thought he was *copying* the array in the `staff` variable to the `softball_team` variable. But actually, he just copied a *reference* to the array - he aliased it. So when he added elements to `staff` and `softball_team`, they both ended up on the *same* array!

{% highlight ruby %}
staff = ["Walsh", "Moreno", "Nash", "Cox",
         "Rios", "Jones", "Gupta", "Hayes"]
softball_team = staff # Aliases the same variable!

# Adds an element to the array...
staff << "Wagner"
# Adds an element to the SAME array!
softball_team << "Zonky the Wonder Squirrel" 

puts "Company staff:", staff
print "\n\n"
puts "Company softball team:", softball_team
{% endhighlight %}

So the output doesn't show the contents of two different arrays; it just prints the same array, twice!

{% highlight text %}
Company staff:
Walsh
Moreno
Nash
Cox
Rios
Jones
Gupta
Hayes
Wagner
Zonky the Wonder Squirrel


Company softball team:
Walsh
Moreno
Nash
Cox
Rios
Jones
Gupta
Hayes
Wagner
Zonky the Wonder Squirrel
{% endhighlight %}

One way to fix this would be to create two separate arrays; to basically copy and paste the array literal.

{% highlight ruby %}
staff = ["Walsh", "Moreno", "Nash", "Cox",
         "Rios", "Jones", "Gupta", "Hayes"]
softball_team = ["Walsh", "Moreno", "Nash", "Cox",
                 "Rios", "Jones", "Gupta", "Hayes"]

# Adds an element to the first array...
staff << "Wagner"
# Adds an element to the second array.
softball_team << "Zonky the Wonder Squirrel" 

puts "Company staff:", staff
print "\n\n"
puts "Company softball team:", softball_team
{% endhighlight %}

But there's another way you should know about (that we didn't cover in the book); the `clone` method. When you call `clone` on an `Array` object, you get a *copy* of that array back. You can modify that array as much as you want, and it won't affect the original array. (That is, you can modify the *array* as much as you want. But be careful! The array still holds aliases to the same objects, so if you modify *those*, the change will be visible in *both* arrays!)

{% highlight ruby %}
staff = ["Walsh", "Moreno", "Nash", "Cox",
         "Rios", "Jones", "Gupta", "Hayes"]
softball_team = staff.clone

# Adds an element to the first array...
staff << "Wagner"
# Adds an element to the cloned array.
softball_team << "Zonky the Wonder Squirrel" 

puts "Company staff:", staff
print "\n\n"
puts "Company softball team:", softball_team
{% endhighlight %}

Both of these programs produce the correct output:

{% highlight text %}
Company staff:
Walsh
Moreno
Nash
Cox
Rios
Jones
Gupta
Hayes
Wagner


Company softball team:
Walsh
Moreno
Nash
Cox
Rios
Jones
Gupta
Hayes
Zonky the Wonder Squirrel
{% endhighlight %}
