## Chapter 2 - Methods and Classes

### Exercise 2: Rectangle class

Create a `Rectangle` class. Add `width` and `height` attributes, with methods to read and write each. (There's a shortcut for doing all that, so if you know the shortcut, by all means use it!) Then add an `area` method that returns the area of the rectangle. (You can calculate this by multiplying the width attribute by the height attribute.)

### Solution

{% highlight ruby %}
class Rectangle
  attr_accessor :width, :height

  def area
    width * height
  end
end

rectangle = Rectangle.new
rectangle.width = 2
rectangle.height = 4
puts rectangle.area
{% endhighlight %}
