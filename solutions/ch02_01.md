## Chapter 2 - Methods and Classes

### Exercise 1: HTML methods

Create a method named `paragraph` that takes a string as a parameter and returns a `<p>` HTML tag. It should create a new string that starts with `<p>`, ends with `</p>`, and contains the parameter string in the middle. Don't just print the string with `puts` inside the method, though; let the string be the method's return value, and let the caller print it.

Then, create an `image` method that returns an `img` tag as a string. It should take 3 parameters: an image source string, a width, and a height. The width and height values should be optional, and should use a default of `100` for each. Interpolate the parameters into the HTML string as the `src`, `width`, and `height` attribute values.

After defining the `paragraph` and `image` methods, try calling them a few times to output some HTML, with image file names and text of your choosing.

### Solution

{% highlight ruby %}
def paragraph(text)
  "<p>#{text}</p>"
end

def image(source, width = 100, height = 100)
  "<img src='#{source}' width='#{width}' height='#{height}'/>"
end

puts paragraph("Hello, world!")
puts image("puppy.jpg", 800, 600)
{% endhighlight %}
