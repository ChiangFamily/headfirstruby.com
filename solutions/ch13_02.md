## Chapter 13 - Unit Testing

### Exercise 2: Test-driven development

Below is code for a `Rectangle` class as well as a unit test for it. The test is failing right now, though, because the `area` and `perimeter` methods are empty. Implement the methods in `Rectangle` so that the tests pass.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'minitest/autorun'

class Rectangle

  attr_accessor :width, :height

  def area
    width * height
  end

  def perimeter
    width * 2 + height * 2
  end

end

class TestRectangle < Minitest::Test

  def test_area
    rectangle = Rectangle.new
    rectangle.width = 2
    rectangle.height = 4
    assert_equal(8, rectangle.area,
      "Area should equal width * height")
  end

  def test_perimeter
    rectangle = Rectangle.new
    rectangle.width = 2
    rectangle.height = 4
    assert_equal(12, rectangle.perimeter,
      "Perimeter should equal width * 2 + height * 2")
  end

end
{% endhighlight %}
