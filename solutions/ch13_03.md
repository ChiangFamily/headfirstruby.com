## Chapter 13 - Unit Testing

### Exercise 3: Test setup

The unit test from the previous exercise has some repeated code for setting up the `Rectangle` object. Move that code to a `setup` method within the test class, to eliminate the duplication. (You'll need to change the local variable that holds the `Rectangle` to an instance variable.)

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'minitest/autorun'

class Rectangle

  attr_accessor :width, :height

  def area
    width * height
  end

  def perimeter
    width * 2 + height * 2
  end

end

class TestRectangle < Minitest::Test

  def setup
    @rectangle = Rectangle.new
    @rectangle.width = 2
    @rectangle.height = 4
  end

  def test_area
    assert_equal(8, @rectangle.area,
      "Area should equal width * height")
  end

  def test_perimeter
    assert_equal(12, @rectangle.perimeter,
      "Perimeter should equal width * 2 + height * 2")
  end

end
{% endhighlight %}
