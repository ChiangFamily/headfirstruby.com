    You're wondering what this Ruby language is all about, and if it's right for you. Let us ask you this: Do you like being productive? Do you feel like all those extra compilers and libraries and class files and keystrokes in your other language bring you closer to a finished product, admiring coworkers, and happy customers? Would you like a language that takes care of the details for you? If you sometimes wish you could stop maintaining boilerplate code and get to work on your problem, then Ruby is for you. Ruby lets you get more done with less code.
